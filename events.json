Simulation of possible futures is difficult to prove in biological systems but may often be the best way to explain behavior. Play behavior in particular, likely involves rehearsal and testing of possible outcomes in a low(er) stakes environment. In this talk, I examine two areas in which great apes might productively use projection and play: teasing and tool use. I present our work on playful teasing, a behavior between play and aggression, in which apes explore, test, and advertise their social relationships. I then discuss an in-progress study on physical cognition using a video game interface to test how apes select and apply tools to solve physical tasks. Together, these studies help reveal the complex ways non-human primates strategically and creatively navigate their social and physical environments.\n\n \n\nStudents, faculty, and staff are welcome to attend!",

    "description": "SAVE THE DATE: Friday, September 26th, 2025 3PM - 8PM in Lakireddy Grand Ballroom - Conference Center at UC Merced. \n\nThe annual UC Merced Leadership Conference is one of the longest-running conferences at UC Merced! The annual conference brings together students, alumni, and guest speakers for a full day in which students learn from speakers the many strategies and skills necessary to engage in leadership and remain life-long learners.  Every year, The Souza Leadership Center brings inspiring speakers who have learned to overcome challenges to find their voice and their confidence as leaders.\n\nQuestions? Contact us at Lead@ucmerced.edu \n\nConference Theme: The Leadership Multiverse: Connecting with IntegrityFor better or worse, we are living in a world shaped by the leaders who came before us—and today, we are shaping the future for those who will come after us. Our actions matter. Whether we recognize it or not, we are part of a deeply connected society. That’s why it’s essential to lead and connect with integrity. \n\nOur theme acknowledges the complexity of our current world—where connection and division often coexist—and calls on student leaders to lead with vision, empathy, and authenticity. “The Leadership Multiverse” represents the many dimensions in which leadership occurs today: on campus, online, within communities, across cultures, and within ourselves.\n\n \n\nThe Student Leadership conference will feature workshops on authentic leadership, identity, leadership and much more! Registration will open soon, all are welcome to attend! \n\n RSVP link - https://studentleadership.ucmerced.edu/conference Learn more at http://ucmerced.presence.io/event/2025-uc-merced-student-leadership-conference",
